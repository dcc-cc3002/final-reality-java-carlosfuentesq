This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com).

Broadly speaking for the combat, the player has a group of characters to control and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer.

There are two different types of characters: the Enemies and the Player Characters. Within the last one,
we can find "Normal" characters (Engineers, Knights and Thiefs) and Mages, which can be Black Mages 
or White Mages and can use Magic, which will be explained later.

Both the Enemies and the Player Characters are able to attack each other, but the Player Characters have an 
inventory and can equip weapons, and the Enemies don't.

There are five different weapons: Axes, Bows, Knifes, Staffs and Swords, each of them has a weight and 
can be equipped only by certain Player Characters. Also, there are five types of Magic: Cure, Fire, 
Poison, Stun and Thunder, each one with a particular effect on the player on which it's apllied; 
in addition, some types of Magic can cause adverse effects on that player, which can be Burning, 
Paralysis or Poisoning.

Each character also has a turn, determined by the weight of their weapon, or by their own weight if 
it's an Enemy, and the turn of a character ends when it attacks or when it uses a Magic.
